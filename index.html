      <h1>The Heist</h1>
      <p>You are Emilia, born on the streets of Raven's Cliff you've learned to fend for yourself and take from the corrupt nobility.</p>
      <p>To control Emilia, use WASD to move around.</p>
      <p>Every piece of treasure you gather is worth 100 gold coins.</p>
      <p>The Guards are corrupt and when they catch you, they'll take a piece of your score.</p>
      <p>Your fence is willing to buy the loot from you, but he'll pay more the quicker you are.</p>
